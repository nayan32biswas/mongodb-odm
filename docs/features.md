# Features

## Designed for simplicity and performance

MongoDB-ODM was created for high performance and simplicity. It adds the <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/" class="external-link" target="_blank">Pydantic</a> model features on top of <a href="https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" class="external-link" target="_blank">PyMongo</a>.

You can get type support on the model thanks to **Pydantic**. All features of **PyMongo** and **Pydantic** will be available.

## Modern Python

It's based on standard **Python** with type annotations. Just standard Python - no new syntax to learn.

## Editor Support

**MongoDB-ODM** was designed to be easy and intuitive to use to ensure the best development experience, with auto-completion.

Great type and autocomplete support on <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" class="external-link" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> and other modern editors.
